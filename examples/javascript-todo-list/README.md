# Multiplayer to-do list with [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io)

This project shows how to build a collaborative to-do list that do not rely on any front-end frameworks.
As users edit the list, changes will be automatically persisted and synced, allowing for a list that updates in real-time across clients.
Users will also be able to see who else is currently online and when a user is typing.

You can also follow our [step by step tutorial](https://liveblocks.io/docs/tutorials/multiplayer-to-do-list/javascript) to build it from scratch.

## Getting started

### Run examples locally

- Create an account on [liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard)

- Copy your public key from the [administration](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys)

- Replace `pk_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` in `static/app.js` with your own public key.

- Run `npm start` and open `http://localhost:8080`
